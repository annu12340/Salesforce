## Usage

### Message Format Conventions

The app responds differently based on the message format:

1. **AgentForce Queries**: Messages starting with "agentforce" will be processed by the AgentForce AI.
   ```
   agentforce What's the status of case #12345?
   ```

2. **New Cases**: Only messages starting with "New cases" will be processed as structured cases.
   ```
   New cases
   Case number: 12345
   Summary: Customer is having trouble logging in
   Team: Support
   Confidence: 80%
   ```

3. **Other Messages**: All other messages will be treated as generic cases with standard team options.

### Standard Case Format

To create a structured case, format your message like this:

```
New cases
Case number: 12345
Summary: Customer is having trouble logging in
Team: Support
Confidence: 80%
```

If confidence is â‰¥ 90%, the case will be automatically routed to the specified team.
If confidence is < 90%, the app will display handoff buttons with the suggested team highlighted.

### Using AgentForce

To process a case with AgentForce, you can either:

1. Start your message with `agentforce` followed by your query:
   ```
   agentforce What's the status of case #12345?
   ```

2. Include `Bot: agentforce` in your structured case message:
   ```
   New cases
   Case number: 12345
   Summary: Customer is having trouble logging in
   Team: Support
   Confidence: 80%
   Bot: agentforce
   ```

3. Click the "Process with AgentForce" button on any case

AgentForce will provide an AI-powered response that is shared in the thread and with the assigned team.

## Troubleshooting

If the bot is not responding to messages, check:

1. The bot has been invited to the channels it needs to monitor
2. The channel IDs in the environment variables are correct
3. The bot has the necessary permissions (scopes)
4. Socket Mode is enabled and the app is running
5. For AgentForce functionality, ensure the Salesforce API credentials are correctly configured
